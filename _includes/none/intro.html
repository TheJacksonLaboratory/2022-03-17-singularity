  <a href="https://sylabs.io/">Singularity</a>
  is a container platform. It allows you to create and run 
  containers that package up pieces of software in a way 
  that is portable and reproducible. You can build a container 
  using Singularity on your laptop, and then run it on many 
  of the largest HPC clusters in the world, local university 
  or company clusters, a single server, in the cloud, or on a 
  workstation down the hall. Your container is a single file, 
  and you donâ€™t have to worry about how to install all the 
  software you need on each different operating system.
  Singularity is key to research reproducibility.
